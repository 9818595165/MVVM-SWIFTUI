# MVVM‑SwiftUI 🌟

A clean, testable iOS app built with SwiftUI following the MVVM architecture.

## 🚀 Features

- **MVVM architecture** – clearly separates Model, View, and ViewModel layers  
- Data‑binding with `@Published` & `@StateObject` for reactive UI  
- Example networking or persistence module (e.g., using URLSession, Combine, or CoreData)  
- Unit and UI test coverage to ensure reliability  
- Clean, modular codebase ideal for learning and scaffold reuse

## 📥 Requirements

- Xcode 14+  
- iOS 16+ (adjust in project settings)  
- Swift 5.8+  

## 🔧 Setup

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/9818595165/MVVM-SWIFTUI.git
   ```
2. Open the project:  
   ```bash
   cd MVVM-SWIFTUI
   open MVVM‑SwiftUI.xcodeproj
   ```
3. Build & run on simulator or device (Cmd+R).

## 🧭 Architectural Overview

- **Model** – data-layer types / CoreData entities  
- **Service** – handles API calls or local storage  
- **ViewModel** – orchestrates business logic, offers `@Published` data for Views  
- **View** – SwiftUI that consumes ViewModel; UI-only responsibility  

Optional testing utilities and dependency injection are included for testability.

## 🧪 Tests

- Run unit tests with `⌘+U`  
- UI tests ensure expected user flows
